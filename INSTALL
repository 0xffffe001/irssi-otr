---------- INSTALL ----------

Usually the following will do:

	$ cmake /path/to/src
	$ make
	$ make install

"make install" will install libotr.so either

1. into the system wide irssi modules folder if you're root or
2. into ~/.irssi/modules if you're not root

---------- RUNTIME DEPENDENCIES ----------

*	libotr >= 3.1.0. Fragmentation has been introduced in that version so
	nothing smaller will work.

*	glib. Will work with < 2.13 but since there are no regexes available
	HTML stripping (OTR spits out HTML sometimes) and nick ignoring won't
	work.

*	irssi. Obviously ;)

---------- BUILD-TIME ONLY DEPENDENCIES ----------

* 	cmake. Sry for that, but I'm not an autofoo fan. If you're running
	< cmake-2.4.7 then configure will try to download a missing module
	(pkgconfig) from the cmake-2.4.7 sources. Should work.

*	pkg-config, python and wget.
