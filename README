Usually, you shouldn't have to do anything besides "/load otr" to have encrypted
conversations.  However,  some IRC  servers  strip  off  the  tabs OTR  uses  as
announcement, there you or your buddy will have to type "?OTR?" to get going.

Initially  a private  key will  also have  to be  generated...that can  take two
minutes or even  an hour. You can wait  for OTR to trigger key  generation or do
"/otr genkey nick@irc.server.com" yourself.

To make  sure that you are  actually talking to your  buddy, you can agree  on a
secret somehow  and then one does  "/otr auth <secret>". Shortly  afterwards the
other one will be asked to do  the same and you're done. Well, unfortunately the
world ain't perfect and  it seems libotr isn't either (goes for  me as well), so
currently only the responder will be  able to authenticate this way. You'll have
to switch roles and do this twice - sry.

I also strongly  recommend to do "/statusbar window add  otr" so you're informed
about  what's going  on.  Status  of "manual"  means  manual authentication  was
performed,  "smp"  means  the  above  protocol  was  used  (the  thing's  called
"socialist millionaire protocol").

In  "~/.irssi/otr/otr.{key,fp}" you'll  find the  fingerprints and  your private
keys(should you at any point be interested).

Commands:

/otr genkey nick@irc.server.com 
	Manually generate a key for the given account(also done on demand)
/otr auth <secret>
	Initiate or respond to an authentication challenge
/otr authabort
	Abort any ongoing authentication
/otr trust
	Trust the fingerprint of the user in the current window.
	You should only do this after comparing fingerprints over a secure line
/otr debug
	Switch debug mode on/off
/otr contexts
	List all OTR contexts along with their fingerprints and status
/otr finish
	Finish an OTR conversation
