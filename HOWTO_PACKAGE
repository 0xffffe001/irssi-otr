Thanks for helping me with packaging.

You'll need cmake >= 2.6. In theory, all you should have to do is:

	$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=packaging-DEB /path/to/src
	$ sudo make package

For an RPM it should be packaging-RPM and for TGZ...you can imagine.

I'm not sure yet if the RPMs/DEBs generated by cmake/CPack are 100% OK. You can
tweak the settings in Packaging-{RPM,DEB}.cmake. If you wanna see how CPack does
it and what variables affect it, check out:

	/usr/share/cmake/Modules/CPackDeb.cmake
	/usr/share/cmake/Modules/CPackRPM.cmake
